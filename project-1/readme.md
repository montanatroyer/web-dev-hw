**My First Live Project**

I use Safari and Firefox.
Basic steps of a web page
- You send a request over the server.
- The server responds with a collection of web content
- The browser interprets the content and displays the page with rendering engines.
  - Rendering engines display both html and and css. Html's are for marking up the content. Css is used to stylize the content.
- Interactive functions on a website are through Javascript and a Javascript interpreter.

On the Wayback Machine, I went to the WorldWideWeb in 1990. The whole thing was black and white. It didn't have any options on limiting your source, such as size, color, etc. There was a page on how to use the web, which we don't have anymore. There were several image buttons on the right, which I don't know what they were for, but we don't have those anymore either.

Project Review:
For this project, I created an html document. Then, I used horizontal rule, paragraph and break codes to create the poem. I then found an image that resembled the poem (a picture of a flower blossoming) and put that on the page through relative URL's. I then reviewed the page through firefox to see how it looked and used github, to put it onto my repository.
