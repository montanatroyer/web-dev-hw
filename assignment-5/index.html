          Hello
          <br />
          I've waited here for you
          <br />
          Everlong
          <br />
          Tonight I throw myself in two
          <br />
          Out of the red
          <br />
          Out of her head she sang
          <br />
          Come down and waste away with me
          <br />
          Down with me
          <br />
          Slow, how you wanted it to be
          <br />
          I'm over my head
          <br />
          Out of her head she sang
          <br />
          <p></p>
          And I wonder
          <br />
          When I sing along with you
          <br />
          If everything could ever feel this real forever
          <br />
          If anything could ever be this good again
          <br />
          The only thing I'll ever ask of you
          <br />
          You've got to promise not to stop when I say when
          <br />
          She sang
          <br />
          <p></p>
          Breathe out
          <br />
          So I can breathe you in
          <br />
          Hold you in
          <br />
          And now
          <br />
          I know you've always been
          <br />
          Out of your head
          <br />
          Out of my head I sang
          <br />
          <p></p>
          And I wonder
          <br />
          When I sing along with you
          <br />
          If everything could ever feel this real forever
          <br />
          If anything could ever be this good again
          <br />
          The only thing I'll ever ask of you
          <br />
          You've got to promise not to stop when I say when
          <br />
          She sang
          <br />
          <p></p>
          And I wonder
          <br />
          If everything could ever feel this real forever
          <br />
          If anything could ever be this good again
          <br />
          The only thing I'll ever ask of you
          <br />
          You've got to promise not to stop when I say when
          <br />
