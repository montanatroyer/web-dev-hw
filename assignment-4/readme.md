Alt text's are detailed descriptions of a photo that are there to help visually impaired people.

Forms that I have come across while browsing the web include search forms such as google search engine, email forms for when sending an email to a company, multiple choice forms when completing surveys and much more.

For this assignment, my first problem I had was in step 2. For some reason, when I put the bold, italic, heading 1, heading 2, etc. information in, it would apply to everything. I figured out though that instead of ending it on /b I was ending it on b/. Next, I wasn't able to figure out the form element, to which I am still unsure if I did correctly. My next problem was when I was creating the table, the rows were not going down to their own seperate line. However, I realized later, that was because I didn't put a <br /> in between lines. Creating all the selection boxes when pretty smoothly. When I got down to the text elements, such as child's name, the first time I did it, it was not well placed. Sometimes, the text was above the box, sometimes it was to the right or left. There was no organization. I kept messing around with places it put breaks in and honestly, I don't know what I did right, but eventually it worked out. Adding the image also went pretty smoothly too.
